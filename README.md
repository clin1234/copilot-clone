# Captain Stack — Code generator and suggestion for VSCode

[![Captain Stack on Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Downloads-VSCode_Marketplace-blue)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=captainstack.captain-stack) [![Captain Stack on Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/d/captainstack.captain-stack)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=captainstack.captain-stack)

This feature is somewhat similar to Github Copilot's code suggestion. But instead of using AI, it sends your search query to Google, then retrieves StackOverflow and Github Gist answers and autocompletes them for you.

✅ OpenAI and OpenRouter added to generate code with AI (Bring Your Own Key)

## 1. Usage

Captain Stack provides Code Search (from Github Gist, StackOverflow), and AI Code Generation (with OpenAI and OpenRouter). With multiple options can be enabled at the same time.

To generate/search code, use `// find {what you need}.`. For example:

```js
// find binary search in JavaScript.

// generate binary search function in Python.
```

Note:
- Make sure there is a dot at the end of `{what you need}` search phrase
- You can use either `// find` or `// generate` to trigger Captain Stack code completion. Both are the same.
